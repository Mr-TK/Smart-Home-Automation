# Smart Home Automation

## Introduction
This system enables remote automation of electronic appliances within your home, providing convenience and safety. Utilizing MQTT protocol, it wirelessly sends messages to a server, triggering actions through Raspberry Pi. It's capable of making decisions autonomously, such as turning off appliances during stormy weather to ensure safety.

## Hardware Requirements
- Raspberry Pi
- Humidity Sensor DHT22
- 5V Relay Module
- Breadboard
- Connecting Wires
- Small Fan
- Light Bulb

## Step-by-Step Guide
### 1. Setup MQTT Server
Set up an MQTT server for communication between devices. You can use popular brokers like Mosquitto or set up your own using Eclipse Paho.

### 2. Install Dependencies
Ensure necessary libraries are installed on the Raspberry Pi. You'll need `paho-mqtt` for MQTT communication and `RPi.GPIO` for GPIO control.

### 3. Connect Relay to Raspberry Pi
Wire the relay module to the Raspberry Pi, typically connecting it to a GPIO pin for control and a power source for the appliances.

### 4. Write Python Script
Create a Python script on the Raspberry Pi to listen for MQTT messages and control the relay. Use `paho-mqtt` to subscribe to a topic and `RPi.GPIO` to manage GPIO pins.

### 5. Set MQTT Parameters
Configure the script with MQTT parameters such as server address, port, topic, and client ID.

### 6. Define Callback Functions
Implement callback functions for MQTT events like connection and message reception. These functions will control the relay based on received messages.

### 7. Connect to MQTT Broker
Establish connection to the MQTT broker using the specified parameters.

### 8. Start MQTT Loop
Initiate the MQTT loop to continuously listen for incoming messages.

### 9. Send MQTT Messages
From other devices or applications, publish MQTT messages to the subscribed topic to trigger actions on the Raspberry Pi.

### 10. Run the Script
Execute the Python script on the Raspberry Pi. It will connect to the MQTT server and respond to incoming messages by controlling the relay.

## Standards and Best Practices
- **Security**: Implement encryption and authentication mechanisms to secure communication between devices and the MQTT server.
- **Error Handling**: Incorporate robust error handling to gracefully manage connection failures, message parsing errors, and other exceptional scenarios.
- **Documentation**: Maintain detailed documentation covering setup instructions, code explanations, and troubleshooting guidelines to assist users and contributors.
- **Testing**: Conduct thorough testing of the system under various conditions to ensure reliability and stability.
- **Scalability**: Design the system with scalability in mind, allowing for seamless expansion to accommodate additional devices and functionalities.
- **Modularity**: Adopt a modular architecture to facilitate easy maintenance, updates, and integration of new features.
- **Compliance**: Adhere to relevant industry standards and regulations, such as IoT security guidelines and data privacy laws.
